Our project is an attempt to recreate the popular video	game, Minecraft.  We extended our hw4 and used concepts from hw5 to do so.  If you don't know what minecraft is, try it out here: https://minecraft.net/  It's essentially legos for your computer, but better.  And cooler.

We added many extra credit features from hw4 (Particles, Advanced/Interesting Lighting effects, Texture Mipmaps, Object Interaction, Collision Detection, Displ\
ay Lists, Procedural World Generation, Portals, and a 2d HUD display.)

Below are all of the features we implemented, with descriptions.

Things we've done:

Everything from hw4
    -Display Lists
    -Re-Instantiated Objects
    -Transformations
    -Fullscreen/Windowed Modes
    -Wireframe mode
    -Toggle Textures/Lighting
    -FPS Style Camera Viewing
    -Frames Per Second Output Data
    -Zoom in/out
    -Taking Screenshots
    -Double Buffering
    -Perspective Projections
    -Hidden Surface Elimination
    -And on, and on...
    
Collision Detection
    We implemented collision detection between the Human Player (Represented by a 2 height tall object, with the 'eye' at height 1.6) and between all of the blocks in the scene.  There is also a coordinate frame forcing no two blocks to ever be in the same square.

Textures
    We implemented new features to our texture implementation from hw4, including:
    -Mipmapping, 3 stages of mipmaps to make textures look more pleasant.
    -Many more textures added, implemented a List + Enum pair representing all the textures.
    -Textures are loaded given only a filename.  Easy to add new textures.
    -GL_Clamp (Psuedo Cell Shading) This gives the black lines around the edge of each block, much faster then wireframe + fill using Opengl.

Animations
    We implemented animations, similar to hw4.
    -Sun moves around the world.
    -HUD highlights depends on which block you select to use.

Block Addition & Subtraction
    We implemented interactive changing of the world, through blocks.  This is in the spirit of the actual minecraft game.
    -Right clicking removes a block
    -Left clicking adds a block
Object Selection
       -Using Raytracer
HUD Screen Overlay
Fog
Shadowing
Procedural World Generation
	   -Trees
	   -Terrains
	   -Underground Objects
	   -world options
	   
Block properties/differences
      -unbreakable
      -diff tex for side and top

Tridirectional motions
	       -Concurent XYZ Motions
	       -Jumping

Time Interaction
     Day/Night
     Changing sun brightness

Point and Directional lighting
      -lambertian + phong
      -Torches
      -Sun
      -attenuation on point lights
      -multiple lighting effects can be enabled

Particle Smoke
      -Torches

Portals
	-Animated Textures
	-Fucking awesome
	-Thinking with portals

//Todo
Drops
     Drop Interaction

Area Lighting
     -Sun
     -Jittering
